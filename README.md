#Python Dictionary:


 A dictionary program that takes a user input word and returns its definition.
 If the user entered a wrongly spelt word, it returns a word closest to the user entered word and its definition if the user desire. If the word does not exist, it returns an error message which asks the user to double check the word entered.
